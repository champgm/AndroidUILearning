# Enhanced Alarms for the Microsoft Band
I received a Microsoft Band as a gift in late 2014 and I was pretty impressed with it. However, it lacks a few features that would make my life easier. One of those features is robust alarm/scheduling capability. When the SDK preview came out, I almost immediately set it up and started exploring it... Only to find that I wouldn't be developing anything specifically for the band. Instead, I would have to write an Android application, which I have NO experience with. So, I jumped in feet first, made a vague imitation of the SDK's sample application, and then went from there. This is the result. Hopefully it will provide helpful extra functionality for some band users and maybe inspire some more good ideas.
